 * @brief Releases all objects in the autorelease pool.
 *
 * This does not free the memory allocated to store pointers to the objects in
 * the pool, so reusing the pool does not allocate any memory until the previous
 * number of objects is exceeded. It behaves this way to optimize loops that
 * always work with the same or similar number of objects and call relaseObjects
 * at the end of the loop, which is propably the most common case for
 * releaseObjects.
 *
 * If a garbage collector is added in the future, it will tell the GC that now
 * is a good time to clean up, as this is often used after a lot of objects
 * have been added to the pool that should be released before the next iteration
 * of a loop, which adds objects again. Thus, it is usually a clean up call.
