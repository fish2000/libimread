 * @brief An exception indicating an object could not be allocated.
 *
 * This exception is preallocated, as when there's no memory, no exception can
 * be allocated of course. That's why you shouldn't and even can't deallocate
 * it.
 *
 * This is the only exception which is not an OFException as it's special. It
 * does not know for which class allocation failed and it should not be handled
 * like other exceptions, as the exception handling code is not allowed to
 * allocate *any* memory.
