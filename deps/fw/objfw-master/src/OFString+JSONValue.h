 * @brief Creates an object from the JSON value of the string.

 * @note This also allows parsing JSON5, an extension of JSON. See

 *
 * @warning Although not specified by the JSON specification, this can also
 *          return primitives like strings and numbers. The rationale behind
 *          this is that most JSON parsers allow JSON data just consisting of a
 *          single primitive, leading to realworld JSON files sometimes only
 *          consisting of a single primitive. Therefore, you should not make any
 *          assumptions about the object returned by this method if you don't
 *          want your program to terminate due to a message not understood, but
 *          instead check the returned object using @ref isKindOfClass:.
 *
