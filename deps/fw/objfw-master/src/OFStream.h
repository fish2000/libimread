 * @note If you want to subclass this, override
 *	 @ref lowlevelReadIntoBuffer:length:, @ref lowlevelWriteBuffer:length:
 *	 and @ref lowlevelIsAtEndOfStream, but nothing else, as those are are
 *	 the methods that do the actual work. OFStream uses those for all other
 *	 methods and does all the caching and other stuff for you. If you
 *	 override these methods without the lowlevel prefix, you *will* break
 *	 caching and get broken results!
