The Amtrak boarding area of Penn Station is open 24 hours and has WiFi on offer in a climate-controlled mezzanine atrium, but to get to the seating, you will need to pretend you have a train ticket (which of course you don’t have one of those because you’re homeless). There are two “Ticketed Passenger Waiting Areas”, one is for Amtrak Regional and NJ Transit ticket holders, but then there is another corral that is literally three times as large reserved for Acela passengers. Both are nominally guarded by an Amtrak flunky who is supposed to check your ticket before letting you sit down—just walk right by them as if you don’t see them with an air of fuck-you self-confidence. ¶ I used to actually take Amtrak a lot, and in addition to my being homeless there, I think I was bothered about having a ticket less than five times, out of like several hundred. Try the Acela area first, because outlets are scarce in both corrals. ¶ The main caveat about Penn Station is in regards to the bathrooms. In a nutshell, the Penn Station Amtrak mezzanine bathrooms are, collectively, one of the worst epicenters of everything that is gross about homelessness. Going into those bathrooms is traumatic enough as a non-homeless person; I will spare you the horrifying details but I witnessed things in there that were made a thousand times worse by realizing they were being… perpetrated… not just by a homeless person, but specifically by another homeless person.

This is the famous glass-cube Apple Store, catty-corner from the southeast tip of Central Park—a store that many people do not realize is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. What? Why the fuck would that be? I do not know, but it is. ¶ In my pre-homeless life I would specifically go there at 4:00am to buy my computers as I could count on the place being relatively deserted, save for a few highly Adderall’ed Apple Geniuses (and, just once, also Richard Dreyfuss, who had left his Plaza apartment across the street to come and talk excitedly about Internet pornography to everyone). Anyway—if you can’t sleep and you need to compute, head to Apple for late-night power and WiFi. ¶ Note though that like all Apple Stores, this one has at least one dedicated private security person at the entrance, and likely one or two more elsewhere in the store. So the dress code here is respectable-member-of-society; those whose homeless attire is strictly Mugatu Derelicte may be turned away at the door.",

Bryant Park, while admittedly outdoors, is swimming in Internet; the classic NYPL building (you know, with the lions and shit, at like the east end of the park) has WiFi too but limited seating (as it is primarily an exhibit hall and office space for all the assuredly sexy librarians) — if you go in the front, walk up the 2nd floor, and cross the balcony to the middle of the building, you’ll see a west-facing corridor with several long wooden desks that, if you are very lucky, are not absolutely 100% jam-packed with other laptop users feasting on the under-the-table outlet power and library-grade wireless. ¶ This little alcove is basically the only spot in the classic NYPL building with the Trinity, so if you can’t find a seat and the weather is inclement enough to keep you out of the park, cross east on the avenue and head one block south to the real NYPL building—it looks and feels like a Mies van der Rohe design for a jail, but there’s WiFi and seating for you (and also all the many other home-free individuals who had the same idea).",
